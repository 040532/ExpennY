# TEAM - DEBUG THUGS
We created a website named 'ExpennY' as a project in hack NITR 4.0 which is an expense tracker developed to solve issues related to budgeting and expenses.
It has a signup and a login page, where in each user can be directed to their own personalized dashboard. Here, we provide 3 categories of finance to choose from.
1 - Savings, 2 - Investments, 3 - Expenses.
The tech stack used here is HTML, CSS,Javascript for frontend and Node, Express for backend, and MongoDB as the database.
